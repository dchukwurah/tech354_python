# Version Control

#### Git uses snapshots instead of the whole thing

#### Its like it takes a picture of it in time has link to the privous code in time

#### adds efficiency makes it fast and allows more to be able to be done

#### Git vs Github - git can be used purely locally, again speeding up processes

#### Three States within git: modified, staged and commmitted

#### modified chaned but not commeted to db, 
#### staged you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into next snapshot
#### committed you have committed

#### ls -a for hidden files 


#### git status - tells you your current files and folders stage i.e. working directory,

#### git commit -m " the message about the commit" = allows you to commit with a message so you can know what is your commit and message
