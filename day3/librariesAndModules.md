# Libraries and Modules in Python

In Python, both libraries and modules are ways to reuse code. They help in breaking down large programs into smaller,
manageable, and organized files.

## Definitions:

- **Module**: A module is a single file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name
  with the suffix `.py` added.

- **Library**: A library is a collection of related modules grouped together. Libraries can contain multiple modules,
  making it easier to manage and organize code.

## How to Use:

To use a module or library in your code, you need to `import` it.
Example:

```python
import math
```

(imports the math module)


## Top 5 Most Used Libraries in Python:
#### (Some of them anyway..)
1. **NumPy**
    - **Usefulness**: It's the foundational package for mathematical computing. It provides support for large
      multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

2. **Pandas**
    - **Usefulness**: Offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It's
      essential for data analysis and cleaning.

3. **Matplotlib**
    - **Usefulness**: A plotting library that provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications.
      It's used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

4. **TensorFlow**
    - **Usefulness**: An open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It's used for both research and
      production at Google.

5. **Requests**
    - **Usefulness**: Allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. It abstracts the complexities of making requests
      behind a simple API, making it easy to send and receive data from web services.
